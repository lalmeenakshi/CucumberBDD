It is used to write User acceptance test for web application.
It used to test the system rather than particular piece of code.
Cucumber is a java framework and Ruby
Gherkin language is use . Its a high level language using Given/When/Then.
Feature----->scenario---->number of steps.
consist of 3 components- features files,step definition and TestRunner
Feature file - contain Gherkins keywords - Given,When,Then,And,As *,But. These keyword is used to define scenario.
 Step Definition - Selenium + java + Annotation.
 TestRunner - Junit. To run feature.To generate output/report.
 cucumber options : dryRun,features,glue,tags,monochrome,format,strict .options are defined in runner class but tags is defined in feature files.
 dryRun: It used to do mapping between the feature file and stepdefinition. dryRun= true. Its will check if both are mapped or not but will not
 execute the test. To execute test dryRun= false
 Monochrome: display the output in a readable format.
 Different reports we can generate- html,json,junit. junit is preferred one.
 Strict - It will check if any step is not defined in stepdefinition file.
 For data driven approach , use regular expression.(without example keyword).
 In test data driven , headers are not provided only columns values are provided
 DataTable with Maps is used for paramation of test case
 Tagging- tagged inb feature files.
OR tags= {"@smoketest , @Regressiontest}
AND tags={"@smoketest" ,"@Regressiontest"}
Ignore tags={"~@Smoketest"}
Hooks used to defined precondition,postconditions(@After,@Before,excel sheet)
Global hooks - pre and post conditions for every scenario.
local hooks(tagged hooks)- pre or post comditions for particular scenario
for global hooks ordering can be done.@After(order=0),@Before(order=1)
